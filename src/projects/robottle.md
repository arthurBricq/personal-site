Robottle was made for an academic event hosted at EPFL, where autonomous robots have to collect plastic bottles in a random environement and bring them back to a recycling area.

Our robot featured **states of the art** technologies, including a **Lidar** to run **SLAM** algorithm, a camera with **Deep Neural Network** for object recognition. You can see more about our robot with this video that we made to illustrate our project.

After I was contacted by NVIDEA developer teams, Robottle became a showcased project and gained its own little referenced on the NVIDEA official [https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/community/jetson-projects#robottle](website)
